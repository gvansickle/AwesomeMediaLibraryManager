libcue (1.4.0)

	[Avuton Olrich]
	* He helped a lot to make compilation on win32 work (it still would break
	  without him). Finding the parallel build bug is also accredited to him.
	  Thanks!

	* support for custom cue values hidden as rem comments

	* prevent the parser from memory leaking/replace strdup() with
	  fixed-size array and strncpy/implement yacc|bison macros for buffer
	  creation/deletion

	* prevent the lexer from memory leaking/replace strdup() with
	  fixed-size array and strncpy

	* cd_delete() and track_delete() methods

	* support for cdtext filename

	* major code clean up

	* initial clean up for libcue

cuetools (1.3.1)

	[Svend Sorensen]
	* Applied most of Branden Robinson's Debian patch
	  (cuetools_1.3-2.diff.gz). This included many fixes and enhancements
	  to tools and manual pages. cuebreakpoints and cueconvert will exit if
	  they fail on any of the input files. cuebreakpoints, cueconvert, and
	  cuetools will exit with a nonzero return value if there was a failure
	  on an input file.

	* Added version option to all tools.

	* Single quoted string support has been removed.  This was broken, and I am not
	  sure of any software that supports single quoted strings in cue or toc files.

cuetools (1.3)

	[Svend Sorensen]
	* Build system has been rewritten using automake/autoconf.

	* Added append, prepend, and split pregap modes to cuebreakpoints.

	* Fixed possible compilation error with Bison.

	* All tools accept long options.

	* Programs exit if --input-format or --output-format is an illegal value.

cuetools (1.2)

	[Svend Sorensen]
	* cuebreakpoints was not printing the last track breakpoint.  This has been
	  fixed.

	* cueprint now prints a zero-length string for undefined values.  Flags, width,
	  and precision are applied to conversion characters which have no conversion.

	* Added a tagging script, cuetag.sh, which uses cueprint, vorbiscomment, and
	  mp3info to tag Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files.  This needs more testing and
	  documentation.

	* Added a track selection flag to cueprint.

cuetools (1.1)

	[Svend Sorensen]
	* File formats documentation has been readded and updated (docs/formats.txt).

	* ``CDTEXTFILE`` is now a recognized (but ignored) keyword.

	* If only a disc or track template is specified on the command line, then only
	  the disc or track information is printed, respectively.

	* cueprint now supports flags and width and precision values for template
