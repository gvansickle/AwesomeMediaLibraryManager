\brief Explains how to promisify callback taking functions into a \ref continuable_base.

\section tutorial-promisify-continuables-promisify Promisification and continuables

The promisification has a longer history in the JavaScript world where
the legacy way of asynchronous programming was the usage of callbacks of the
form \code{.js}function(error, result...)\endcode. The ideal way of dealing
with such an asynchronous result is to return a promise and soon utility
helpers were provided to do so.

The usage of callbacks to represent an asynchronous result is still a popular
way nowadays. Thus the library provides the \ref promisify helper class
which makes it possible to convert callback taking functions of various styles
into one that returns a \ref continuable_base instead.

\note Providing promisified APIs for other popular libraries is out of
      scope for this library. However contributions are highly welcome to
      add more conversion helpers for other commonly used callback styles.

\section tutorial-promisify-continuables-boost Promisify boost::asio

The default callback style is something like
\code{.js}function(error, result...)\endcode as described above.
Continuable offers the \ref promisify::from method for such callback styles.

See an example of how to promisify boost asio's `async_resolve` below:
  
\code{.cpp}
auto async_resolve(std::string host, std::string service) {
  return cti::promisify<asio::ip::udp::resolver::iterator>::from(
      [&](auto&&... args) {
        resolver_.async_resolve(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...);
      },
      std::move(host), std::move(service));
}
\endcode

Then it should be possible to use `asio::async_resolve` like this:

\code{.cpp}
async_resolve("127.0.0.1", "daytime")
  .then([](udp::resolver::iterator iterator) {
    // ...
  });
\endcode

}
