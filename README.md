Really this is just me experimenting with a number of things:
- The Qt application framework
- Creating a complete Qt GUI app, including:
  - A portable installer
  - Unit testing via GoogleTest and QTest
  - Coordinating all build duties with CMake.
- Adding continuations (".then()") to QFuture()s.
- ...and I'm sure a bunch of other stuff I've forgotten since I last touched this.

The Windows installer [here](https://github.com/gvansickle/AwesomeMediaLibraryManager/releases/tag/0.0.1.1) worked the last time I tried it and gave you a not-completely-useless media player for your troubles.

I should maybe get back to this project some day....
